"In spite of the difficult times for our city, under the explosions and the roar of cannonade, KharkivMusicFest remains with the people of Kharkiv. The war has been going on for a month and all possible words of support for Kharkiv residents have been said many times. But the language of music is multifaceted, it will surely find its way to the heart of each of us--- to support, motivate, inspire or soothe. And the main thing is that in spite of everything in the destroyed by bombs and shells, but unconquered Kharkiv, classical music will still be heard, “ says Maria Gorbonos, executive director of the festival.
