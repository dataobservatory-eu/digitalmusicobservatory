In July 2020, Professor Paul Carr of [University of South Wales](http://staff.southwales.ac.uk/users/381-pcarr) was commissioned by [Senedd Cymru â€“ the Welsh Parliament]() to create a report examining the â€˜*state of play*â€™ in the post Covid-19 music industries in Wales.

*[Click through](https://twitter.com/SeneddCWLC/status/1185216516201111555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) to see a short interview with Prof. Paul Carr*

The music industries in Wales consist of both part-time and full-time stakeholders and  although dominated by live and recording sectors, also comprise of other sub-sectors, and like in other countries that we surveyed in Central and Eastern Europe, many stakeholders in the music industries are freelancers, following [multi-track careers](https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/supply.html#creators-of-music).

Prof. Carr's report is particularly interesting for our [Music Observatory](https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/) project because the Welsh nation is a part of a larger entity, the United Kingdom, and many important statistical products may need to be recreated for this sub-national level --- something we have been doing with [our survey retroharmonization](https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-04-16-regional-opendata-release/) and [regional statistical tools](https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/) for some time.

*The Welsh Music Industries in a Post-Covid World* will be presented to the [Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee](https://senedd.wales/en/bus-home/committees/Pages/Committee-Profile.aspx?cid=445) later this month, and we will publish the entire report in English and start a discussion around it, too.
