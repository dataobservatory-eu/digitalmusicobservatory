Launched in Milan in 2018, it is the first social enterprise of its kind in Italy and is backed by Fondazione Giordano dellâ€™Amore Social Venture - the social impact investment fund from Fondazione Cariplo---, OxA srl, and Music Management Club. MIH develops solutions that support the growth of the music industry and its stakeholders, and helps businesses find a more sustainable future through music projects.

MIH promotes a range of programmes for training, incubation, acceleration and networking on an international level, including [Music Tech Europe](https://www.musictecheuropeacademy.eu/), [CreativeSHIFT](https://creativeshift.eu/) and [JUMP](https://www.jumpmusic.eu/), as well as creating solidarity projects like Scena Unita and Covid-19---Sosteniamo la Musica in response to the 2020 health crisis and to support entertainment professionals. MIH produces formats and events, including Heroes, the first large-scale hybrid concert in the history of Italian music, and Linecheck, the foremost international networking event for the Italian music industry.

MIH created and now run the BASE Milano musicROOMS, a multi-purpose space that brings together professionals from across the music industry.

MIH sees Music as a driver of social innovation: Music is Social Change.
